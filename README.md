# AHK2 SystemUtils

A set of general-purpose [AHK2](https://www.autohotkey.com/v2/) tools built into a single script.
While this is intended for my own purpose it could be useful as a reference for others doing anything similar.

# Features
## Pause Key pauses media
Some keyboards have dedicated pause buttons to pause media, some such as mine are more olde schoole and don't. This maps the (almost unused) `Pause` key to act as a media pause button.

# Resources
* This is an [AHK2](https://www.autohotkey.com/v2/) script and so that's required..
* Virtual desktop control is based on the [VirtualDesktopAccessor.dll](https://github.com/Ciantic/VirtualDesktopAccessor) tool which is included in the repo, and a lot of the Virtual Desktop code is based on the [AHK2 Example Script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ciantic/VirtualDesktopAccessor/refs/heads/rust/example.ah2)
